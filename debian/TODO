- DONE : libudns to libc-ares transition : libudns is to be dropped one day
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=493599
http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/b49eeba96bfd4b4

- DONE : However, libc-ares 1.7.1 currently does not support parse_mx_reply, it's been
added upstream, so the corresponding debian/patches/cares-disable-mx.patch must
be removed when 1.7.2 is released and available as a debian package.

- DONE : add a "js" alternative ?

- NOT NEEDED (never released) : Remove nodejs alternative

- DONE : Update README.Debian to explain /usr/local/lib/nodejs for modules installed manually or by npm.

- support node shebang, notice lintian maintainers ?
