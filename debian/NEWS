nodejs (0.4.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

    Do not search for modules in /usr/local/lib/nodejs.
    That folder, populated by npm, used to be in the search path :
    this is a mistake, using those modules in a user project is done with
    `npm link mymodule`, *not* by changing NODE_PATH nor require.paths.
    System-wide search path is only /usr/lib/nodejs, where modules installed
    by debian packages go.

    npm >= 1.0 (when released) install path for 'global' modules will be
    /usr/local/lib/node_modules.
