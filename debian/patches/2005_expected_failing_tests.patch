Description: Expected failing tests
 There are three categories of failing tests:
 1 - because of build server without external network access
 2 - the test itself is buggy (race condition under heavy load,
     problem with the external command that is called)
 3 - the test is legitimately failing, but no one knows why and
     that prevents the package from being updated.
 Some of these test may not fail with nodejs 0.8.x. Disable them
 to see what happens.
