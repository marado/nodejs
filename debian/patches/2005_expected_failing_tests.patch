Description: Expected failing tests
 There are three categories of failing tests:
 * because of build server without external network access
 * the test itself is buggy (race condition under heavy load,
   problem with the external command that is called)
 * the test is legitimately failing, but no one knows why and
   that prevents the package from being updated.
 That last type was #660802 and has been fixed.
